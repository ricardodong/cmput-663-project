I	s
have	s
a	s
list	s
that	s
is	s
the	s
and	s
I	s
want	s
to	s
change	s
with	s
type.	s
How	s
can	s
I	s
do	s
this?	s
I	s
tried	s
this	s
way	s
a=[0,1]	c
a=[0x00,0x001]	c
Using	s
hex	s
directly	s
should	s
work:	s
You	s
can	s
the	s
string	s
as	s
hex	s
and	s
the	s
needed	s
amount	s
of	s
zeros	s
and	s
prepending	s
to	s
it	s
yourself:	s
format(...)	c
zfill()	c
'0x'	c
As	s
you	s
fail	s
to	s
describe	s
what	s
your	s
wanted	s
outcome	s
is,	s
I	s
can	s
only	s
guess:	s
Then	s
it	s
doesn't	s
matter	s
which	s
format	s
you	s
use,	s
both	s
should	s
work	s
as	s
soon	s
as	s
you	s
use	s
the	s
correct	s
format	s
string:	s
So,	s
I'm	s
trying	s
to	s
put	s
numbers	s
into	s
a	s
list	s
and	s
square	s
and	s
print	s
them	s
all.	s
The	s
first	s
line	s
-	s
prints	s
square	s
root	s
and	s
the	s
second	s
-	s
prints	s
the	s
square.	s
print	c
(math.sqrt(item))	c
print	c
(item*item)	c
SyntaxError	s
is	s
due	s
to	s
missing	s
closing	s
parenthesis	s
on	s
line	s
4	s
should	s
be	s
list(map(float,	c
ListNum)	c
list(map(float,	c
ListNum))	c
Sometimes	s
the	s
error	s
is	s
on	s
the	s
previous	s
line	s
(line	s
4	s
in	s
this	s
case),	s
not	s
the	s
one	s
indicated	s
in	s
the	s
traceback	s
(in	s
this	s
case	s
line	s
5).	s
And	s
is	s
calculating	s
for	s
square	s
root:	s
math.sqrt	c
In	s
the	s
document	s
of	s
python3,	s
which	s
you	s
can	s
find	s
the	s
link	s
at	s
the	s
bottom,	s
is	s
described	s
as	s
math.sqrt()	c
You	s
can't	s
take	s
the	s
square	s
root	s
of	s
a	s
list,	s
and	s
is	s
a	s
list.	s
ListNum	c
The	s
code	s
will	s
not	s
deliver	s
what	s
you	s
expect	s
though.	s
I	s
have	s
list	s
of	s
files	s
in	s
directory,ending	s
with	s
numeric.	s
I'm	s
able	s
to	s
extract	s
the	s
last	s
numeric	s
digit	s
of	s
above	s
files.	s
Now	s
Here	s
i'm	s
trying	s
to	s
list	s
all	s
files	s
which	s
have	s
higher	s
version	s
then	s
.	s
play_football_5	c
You	s
can	s
use	s
for	s
this:	s
awk	c
will	s
list	s
all	s
files	s
in	s
the	s
current	s
directory	s
start	s
with	s
and	s
filters	s
the	s
files	s
with	s
the	s
number	s
greater	s
than	s
5	s
printf	c
play_football_	c
awk	c
With	s
these	s
methods	s
when	s
i	s
execute	s
the	s
class,	s
the	s
testng	s
executes	s
in	s
the	s
below	s
order	s
This	s
is	s
usually	s
achieved	s
in	s
by	s
using	s
either	s
or	s
attribute	s
for	s
the	s
annotation	s
TestNG	c
dependsOnMethods	c
dependsOnGroups	c
@Test	c
You	s
do	s
this	s
by	s
implementing	s
the	s
interface	s
and	s
then	s
wiring	s
in	s
the	s
implementation	s
via	s
one	s
of	s
the	s
following	s
means	s
org.testng.IMethodInterceptor	c
The	s
example	s
as	s
you	s
would	s
have	s
noticed	s
neither	s
uses	s
priority	s
nor	s
dependsOnMethods/dependsOnGroups	c
You	s
miss	s
to	s
put	s
curly	s
brackets	s
in	s
parameter	s
It	s
should	s
be	s
like	s
TestNG	c
(dependsOnMethods	c

"Submission01")	c
(dependsOnMethods	c

{"Submission01"})	c
I	s
have	s
just	s
began	s
playing	s
around	s
with	s
React	s
hooks	s
and	s
am	s
wondering	s
how	s
an	s
AJAX	s
request	s
should	s
look?	s
I	s
have	s
tried	s
many	s
attempts,	s
but	s
am	s
unable	s
to	s
get	s
it	s
to	s
work,	s
and	s
also	s
don't	s
really	s
know	s
the	s
best	s
way	s
to	s
implement	s
it	s
You	s
could	s
create	s
a	s
custom	s
hook	s
called	s
that	s
will	s
implement	s
the	s
hook.	s
useFetch	c
useEffect	c
By	s
passing	s
an	s
empty	s
array	s
as	s
the	s
second	s
argument	s
to	s
the	s
hook	s
will	s
trigger	s
the	s
request	s
on	s
useEffect	c
componentDidMount	c
Great	s
answers	s
so	s
far,	s
but	s
I'll	s
add	s
a	s
custom	s
hook	s
for	s
when	s
you	s
want	s
to	s
trigger	s
a	s
request,	s
because	s
you	s
can	s
do	s
that	s
too.	s
You	s
can	s
create	s
a	s
function	s
using	s
this	s
hook	s
for	s
a	s
specific	s
API	s
method	s
like	s
so	s
if	s
you	s
wish	s
And	s
then	s
just	s
point	s
to	s
an	s
or	s
handler	s
createTodo	c
onSubmit	c
onClick	c
So,	s
the	s
correct	s
way	s
is:	s
where	s
can	s
be	s
written	s
as:	s
useEffect(()	c
=>	c
{	c
fetchData()	c
})	c
fetchData	c
async	c
function	c
fetchData()	c
{	c
...}	c
Here's	s
something	s
which	s
I	s
think	s
will	s
work:	s
There	s
are	s
couple	s
of	s
important	s
bits:	s
Traditionally,	s
you	s
would	s
write	s
the	s
Ajax	s
call	s
in	s
the	s
lifecycle	s
of	s
class	s
components	s
componentDidMount	c
The	s
dispose	s
function	s
is	s
very	s
important	s
you	s
can	s
use	s
that	s
function	s
to	s
cancel	s
a	s
request,	s
clear	s
a	s
timer	s
etc.	s
Any	s
async	s
function	s
will	s
return	s
a	s
promise,	s
but	s
not	s
a	s
function,	s
so	s
the	s
dispose	s
function	s
actually	s
takes	s
no	s
effects.	s
I	s
have	s
a	s
comment	s
section	s
where	s
the	s
user	s
can	s
enter	s
comments,	s
it	s
automatically	s
displays	s
comments	s
and	s
the	s
time	s
the	s
comment	s
was	s
entered.	s
Add	s
for	s
the	s
in	s
order	s
to	s
align	s
time	s
to	s
right	s
.comments_wrapper	c
flex:	c
auto;	c
Hope	s
this	s
will	s
help.	s
selector	s
not	s
taking	s
rest	s
of	s
the	s
place	s
that's	s
why	s
you	s
not	s
seeing	s
the	s
effect.	s
comments_wrapper	c
You	s
need	s
to	s
set	s
the	s
width	s
of	s
the	s
.comments_wrapper	c
Add	s
.comments_wrapper	s
flex:	c
auto;	c

I'm	s
trying	s
to	s

As	s
others	s
have	s
said,	s
your	s
method	s
is	s
wrong.	s
compareTo	c
You	s
should	s
never	s
when	s
two	s
instances	s
are	s
equal.	s
return	c
1	c
but	s
also	s
because	s
you	s
are	s
comparing	s
students	s
based	s
only	s
on	s
their	s
age	s
Luckily,	s
each	s
student	s
has	s
a	s
unique	s
ID,	s
so	s
you	s
could	s
use	s
this	s
id	s
to	s
break	s
ties	s
Your	s
compare	s
method	s
is	s
simply	s
spoken	s
plain	s
wrong.	s
I	s
would	s
drop	s
the	s
Comparable	s
interface	s
from	s
Student,	s
and	s
instead	s
implement	s
standalone	s

You	s
can	s

you	s

all	s
I	s
need	s
to	s
do	s
is	s
<app-display-loading>	c
but	s
first	s
you	s
need	s
to	s
add	s

the	s

in	s
which	s
the	s

Hi	s
you	s
can	s
use	s
HTTP	s
interceptor	s
for	s
displaying	s
spinner	s
in	s
every	s

Or	s
you	s
can	s
use	s
your	s
loading	s
component	s
on	s
higher	s
level	s
and	s
by	s
CSS	s
you	s
can	s
show	s
loading	s
on	s
whole	s
page	s
so	s
you	s
don't	s
need	s
else	s
condition	s
part.	s
You	s
can	s
do	s
that	s
using	s
like:	s
ng-template	c

you	s
explain	s
more?	s
JSON	s

you	s

code	s
First	s
remove	s
