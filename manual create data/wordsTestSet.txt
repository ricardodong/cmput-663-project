a	s

index	s

the	s
indexes	s
are	s
L1[1234]	c
1234	c
L1	c
0,1	c
I	s
understand	s
that	s
the	s
list	s
has	s
my	s
potential	s
value	s
for	s
the	s
index	s
as	s
a	s
value	s
stored	s
and	s
in	s
unicode	s
Assuming	s
you	s
have	s
a	s
list	s
of	s
dicts	s
you	s
could	s
do	s
something	s
like	s
this:	s
I'm	s
very	s
new	s
to	s
functional	s
programming	s
and	s
I	s
am	s
open	s
to	s
any	s
ideas.	s
The	s
trouble	s
is	s
that	s
and	s
are	s
functions.	s
R.prop('id')	c
R.prop('name')	c
does	s
not	s
accept	s
functions	s
R.assoc	c
accepts	s
numbers	s
R.multiply	c
If	s
we	s
supply	s
with	s
two	s
functions	s
lift(multiply)	c
Unfortunately,	s
this	s
fails	s
again.	s
In	s
the	s
first	s
one,	s
you	s
could	s
replace	s
with	s
without	s
any	s
real	s
issues	s
R.merge	c
Object.assign	c
This	s
solutions	s
uses	s
and	s
R.props	c
R.fromPairs	c
You	s
could	s
achieve	s
this	s
by	s
the	s
following:	s
You	s
can	s
create	s
a	s
pipeline	s
(	s
)	s
to	s
convert	s
your	s
array	s
of	s
objects	s
to	s
a	s
hash:	s
R.pipe	c
This	s
needs	s
to	s
be	s
a	s
unique	s
number.	s
the	s
code	s
should	s
check	s
the	s
database	s
if	s
this	s
number	s
doesn't	s
already	s
exist.	s
What	s
I	s
have	s
results	s
in	s
a	s
page	s
crash	s
Not	s
to	s
mention,	s
what	s
you	s
have	s
here	s
will	s
not	s
call	s
again	s
checkRandNR()	c
Perhaps	s
it	s
would	s
be	s
more	s
advisable	s
to	s
send	s
a	s
batch	s
of	s
random	s
numbers	s
with	s
or	s
something	s
so	s
that	s
you	s
are	s
less	s
likely	s

perform	s
multiple	s
trips	s
to	s
the	s
database	s
WHERE	c
uid	c

I	s
used	s
this	s
in	s
one	s
of	s
my	s
projects	s
to	s
generate	s
ID:	s
Based	s
on	s
the	s
answers	s

this	s
is	s
what	s
I	s
made,	s
which	s
works!	s
Note	s

bs.reduce((o,	c

Object.assign(o,	c

{})	c
This	s
does	s
not	s
actually	s
answer	s
the	s
question	s
as	s
asked	s
could	s
directly	s
substitute	s
the	s
spread	s
syntax	s
and	s
mutate	s
the	s
existing	s

sacrificing	s
much	s
of	s
your	s
brevity	s
Object.assign()	c
Iterate	s

Array.reduce()	c
When	s
done,	s
spread	s
the	s
Map's	s
values	s
through	s
Math.min()	c
and	s
note	s
that	s
lookup	s
could	s
deteriorate	s
from	s
~O(1)	s
to	s
O(log(n))	s
which	s
would	s
give	s
you	s
a	s
total	s
time	s
complexity	s
of	s
O(n	s

The	s
approach	s
can	s
be	s
constructing	s
a	s
hash-map	s
while	s
iterating	s
over	s

access	s

Hello	s
I'm	s
trying	s
to	s
remove	s
the	s
actions	s
property	s
from	s
each	s
object	s
within	s
the	s
array	s
data:	s
returns	s
when	s
a	s
bot	s
is	s
standing	s
and	s
when	s
not	s
.upRight()	c
true	c
false	c
The	s
issue	s
I'm	s
facing,	s
is	s
that	s
if	s
the	s
method	s
returns	s
for	s
the	s
first	s
"bot"	s
isUpright()	c
true	c
if	s
can	s
transition	s
from	s
to	s
over	s
time	s
isUpright()	c
false	c
true	c
The	s
constructor	s
for	s
will	s
be	s
used	s
to	s
construct	s
a	s
temporary	s
that	s
will	s
live	s
for	s
the	s
whole	s
lifetime	s
of	s
the	s
function	s
std::string(const	c
char*)	c
When	s
the	s
temporary	s
is	s
bound	s
to	s
the	s
,	s
the	s
temporary	s
is	s
lifetime	s
extended	s
std::string	c
const	c
std::string&	c
s	c
Note	s
when	s
you	s
say	s
until	s
the	s
call	s
to	s
foo	s
return	s
is	s
not	s
the	s
same	s
as	s
completion	s
of	s
the	s
full-expression	s
containing	s
the	s
call.	s
As	s
long	s
as	s
you	s
are	s
not	s
doing	s
something	s
like:	s
Or	s
anything	s
like	s
storing	s
a	s
reference	s
to	s
this	s
const	s
ref,	s
you	s
should	s
be	s
fine.	s
I	s
would	s
import	s
class	s
in	s
nodejs	s
and	s
use	s
it	s
in	s
app.ts	c
Create	s
with	s
and	s
run	s
app.ts	c
console.log('hello	c
world');	c
node	c
app.ts	c
However,	s
once	s
you	s
add	s
typescript	s
syntax	s
(	s
)	s
then	s
it	s
breaks	s
const	c
foo:	c
string	c
=	c
'bar';	c
is	s
a	s
typescript	s
syntax,	s
it	s
won't	s
work	s
in	s
a	s
file.	s
import	c
{	c
something	c
}	c
.js	c
You	s
use	s
to	s
create	s
a	s
tuple	s
form	s
2	s
variables.	s
tuple(x,	c
y)	c
This	s
one	s
liner	s
will	s
achieve	s
what	s
you	s
want.	s
One	s
way	s
is	s
to	s
convert	s
both	s
the	s
nested	s
lists	s
into	s
full	s
lists	s
and	s
then	s
use	s
zip.	s
Sample	s
code	s
below:	s
and	s
i	s
want	s
to	s
check	s
if	s
the	s
following	s
list	s
is	s
the	s
same	s
as	s
one	s
of	s
the	s
lists	s
that	s
the	s
array	s
consist	s
of:	s
The	s
builtin	s
short-circuits	s
so	s
that	s
you	s
don't	s
have	s
extra	s
evaluations	s
that	s
you	s
don't	s
need	s
any()	c
You	s
can	s
do	s
it	s
by	s
using	s
broadcasting	s
like	s
this:	s
This	s
applies	s
to	s
example	s
such	s
as	s
A	c
=	c
np.array([[2,3,4],[2,3,4]])	c
It	s
seems	s
I	s
can't	s
sort	s
char	s
array	s
with	s
method	s
so	s
that's	s
why	s
I	s
used	s
a	s
second	s
map	s
operator.	s
Stream.sorted()	c
Instead	s
of	s
creating	s
and	s
sorting	s
a	s
or	s
char[]	c
int[]	c
Of	s
course,	s
you	s
can	s
also	s
use	s
instead	s
of	s
the	s
series	s
of	s
four	s
maps	s
map(s	c
->	c
Arrays.toString(s.chars().sorted().toArray()))	c
Also,	s
you	s
could	s
use	s
to	s
make	s
the	s
arrays	s
comparable,	s
which	s
should	s
be	s
considerably	s
faster	s
than	s
IntBuffer.wrap	c
Arrays.toString	c
you	s
get	s
it	s
for	s
free	s
when	s
you	s
wrap	s
the	s
array	s
Note	s
that	s
for	s
method	s
references	s
of	s
the	s
form	s
expression::name	c
the	s
expression	s
is	s
evaluate	s
once	s
and	s
the	s
result	s
captured,	s
so	s
is	s
evaluated	s
only	s
once	s
for	s
the	s
entire	s
stream	s
operation	s
canonical(list[0])	c
However,	s
I	s
do	s
think	s
that	s
it's	s
strange	s
to	s
return	s
false	s
if	s
the	s
list	s
is	s
empty	s
All	s
we	s
need	s
is,	s
for	s
each	s
word	s
of	s
the	s
list,	s
to	s
count	s
the	s
occurrences	s
of	s
each	s
character.	s
For	s
this,	s
we're	s
collecting	s
each	s
word's	s
characters	s
to	s
a	s
,	s
with	s
the	s
keys	s
being	s
each	s
character	s
Map<Integer,	c
Long>	c
While	s
this	s
is	s
true,	s
I	s
wonder	s
whether	s
this	s
is	s
any	s
faster,	s
or	s
even	s
slower,	s
provided	s
that	s
this	s
method	s
presumably	s
presents	s
much	s
greater	s
overhead	s
for	s
short	s
strings	s
you	s
are	s
right,	s
but	s
for	s
these,	s
it	s
probably	s
doesn't	s
matter	s
anyway.	s
I'm	s
guessing	s
this	s
is	s
what	s
you	s
what?	s
Don't	s
write	s
your	s
own	s
parser.	s
If	s
you	s
only	s
need	s
to	s
read	s
that	s
string	s
in	s
each	s
element	s
of	s
the	s
array	s
So	s
would	s
get	s
and	s
parse	s
the	s
nested	s
JSON.	s
(JSONArray)JSONValue.parse((String)JsonRow.get("PARAMS"))	c
I	s
have	s
a	s
list	s
of	s
dicts	s
like	s
this:	s
returns	s
a	s
object,	s
which	s
is	s
an	s
iterable	s
containing	s
all	s
the	s
values	s
of	s
the	s
dict	s
dict.values	c
dict_values	c
is	s
a	s
classic	s
"transposition"	s
recipe,	s
which	s
takes	s
an	s
iterable-of-iterables	s
and	s
effectively	s
flips	s
it	s
diagonally.	s
zip(*thing)	c
becomes	s
[[a,b],[c,d]]	c
[[a,c],	c
[b,d]]	c
You	s
can	s
use	s
to	s
guarantee	s
ordering	s
of	s
values:	s
operator.itemgetter	c
This	s
can	s
be	s
a	s
little	s
bit	s
more	s
memory	s
friendly:	s
list(zip(*(i.values()	c
for	c
i	c
in	c
l)))	c
It	s
seems	s
that	s
this	s
does	s
basically	s
the	s
same	s
as	s
@Kevin's	s
solution	s
with	s
a	s
listcomp	s
instead	s
of	s
a	s
map,	s
correct?	s
your	s
code	s
is	s
fine,	s
readable	s
and	s
efficient,	s
which	s
sounds	s
Pythonic	s
to	s
me.	s
You	s
can	s
get	s
the	s
desired	s
information	s
directly:	s
If	s
you're	s
working	s
with	s
a	s
large	s
list	s
of	s
dicts,	s
you	s
might	s
want	s
to	s
consider	s
pandas.	s
You	s
could	s
initialize	s
a	s
directly:	s
DataFrame	c
will	s
if	s
a	s
product	s
type	s
is	s
none	s
of	s
them	s
products.type	c
IN	c
('FooProduct',	c
'BarProduct')	c
return	c
0	c
Instead	s
of	s
using	s
Correlated	s
subqueries,	s
This	s
is	s
a	s
basic	s
solution,	s
not	s
so	s
efficient	s
but	s
easy:	s
This	s
gets	s
orders	s
that	s
have	s
some	s
other	s
product,	s
but	s
it	s
doesn't	s
pick	s
up	s
orders	s
that	s
are	s
mixes	s
only	s
of	s
foo	s
and	s
bar.	s
I	s
am	s
trying	s
to	s
find	s
the	s
inverse	s
matrix	s
of	s
a	s
given	s
matrix	s
using	s
the	s
function	s
np.linalg.inv()	c
The	s
question	s
is,	s
is	s
the	s
matrix	s
close	s
to	s
or	s
not.	s
np.eye(4)	c
It	s
seems	s
like	s
you	s
just	s
want	s
to	s
know	s
how	s
to	s
get	s
the	s
identity	s
matrix	s
and	s
compare	s
if	s
the	s
results	s
of	s
your	s
matrix	s
multiplication	s
are	s
close	s
to	s
it.	s
I've	s
set	s
up	s
a	s
timer	s
for	s
a	s
function	s
I	s
am	s
timing,	s
but	s
want	s
it	s
to	s
reset	s
after	s
a	s
condition	s
is	s
met	s
The	s
answer	s
to	s
your	s
question	s
as	s
is	s
in	s
an	s
easy	s
Rails-like	s
way	s
to	s
reset	s
after	s
a	s
minute	s
could	s
be:	s
Also	s
you	s
have	s
this	s
comment:	s
places	s
the	s
time	s
it	s
takes	s
for	s
each	s
loop.	s
That's	s
not	s
exactly	s
true	s
in	s
your	s
code	s
here,	s
since	s
you	s
aren't	s
resetting	s
timestart	s

What	s
exactly	s
are	s
you	s

change	s
your	s

you	s
are	s

my	s

first	s

You	s
overrode	s
the	s

that	s
only	s
accepts	s

That	s
means	s
it	s

but	s
not	s
Employee(1287123)	c

Python	s
does	s
very	s
little	s
"magic"	s
in	s
creating	s
classes	s
you	s
usually	s
get	s
precisely	s
what	s
you	s
specified	s
It	s
is	s
good	s
practice	s
not	s

This	s
problem	s
is	s

clear	s

you	s
try	s

combine	s
this	s

I	s
would	s
personally	s
recommend	s
simply	s
using	s

Math.random()	c
are	s
we	s
not	s
just	s
doing	s

is	s
converted	s
to	s
the	s
timestamp	s

So	s
if	s
we	s
have	s
e.x.	s
the	s
result	s
will	s
be	s
something	s
between	s

Actually,	s
the	s

translated	s

propably	s
more	s
clear	s

selects	s
only	s
first	s
div	s
document.getElementById("message").style.display	c
=	c
"block";	c
As	s
the	s
others	s
have	s
mentioned	s
ids	s
are	s
unique	s
and	s
can	s
only	s
be	s
used	s
once	s
on	s
a	s
page,	s
so	s
use	s
a	s
class	s
instead	s
There's	s
also	s
which	s
is	s
much	s
more	s
powerful	s
document.querySelectorAll()	c
You	s
can	s
use	s
jquery	s
and	s
its	s
selector	s
Try	s
changing	s
the	s
initialization	s
of	s
number_max	s
from	s

number_max	c
=	c
user_number	c
number_max	c

100	c
The	s
solution	s
to	s
my	s
problem	s
was	s
so	s
obvious	s
Is	s
there's	s
way	s
to	s
set	s
Button	s
width	s
50%	s
of	s
the	s
total	s
screen	s
size	s
Actually,you	s
could	s
use	s
push	s
to	s
fix	s
it.	s
assigning	s
the	s
entire	s
array	s
with	s
the	s
object	s
{	c
personToList:	c
personToList	c
}	c
Just	s
use	s
but	s
set	s
your	s
state	s
like	s
this	s
list.push(personToList)	c
this.state.newPerson	c
=	c
[];	c
First,	s
make	s
sure	s
you	s
installed	s
and	s
react@next	c
react-dom@next	c
When	s
doing	s
this,	s
be	s
careful	s
with	s
the	s
sequence	s
of	s
your	s
conditions	s
as	s
putting	s
(hours	s
<	s
10)	s
(hours	s
<	s
6)	s
before	c
would	c
break	c
the	c
code	c
if	s
you	s
used	s
they	s
would	s
be	s
the	s
same.	s
instance_variable_set("@name",	c
value)	c
In	s
the	s
case	s
of	s
a	s
"simple"	s
variable	s
assignment	s
for	s
an	s
instance	s
variable	s
like	s
As	s
per	s
your	s
question	s
Aren't	s
these	s
two	s
lines	s
the	s
same	s
but	s
isn't	s
the	s
use	s
people	s
tend	s
to	s
give	s
While	s
is	s
accessible	s
only	s

within	s
the	s
scope	s
where	s
the	s
instance	s
variable	s
is	s
defined	s
@name	c

value	c
there	s
is	s
less	s
chance	s
of	s
introducing	s
a	s
bug	s
and	s
(k.cut	c

I'm	s
getting	s
the	s

As	s
many	s
folks	s
have	s
pointed	s
out	s
you	s
have	s
a	s
problem	s
because	s
in	s
using	s
typedef	s
you	s
went	s
one	s
step	s
too	s
far	s
I	s
cannot	s
use	s
a	s
radio	s
button	s
and	s
checkboxes	s
name/id	s
cannot	s
be	s
similar	s
man	s
you	s
are	s
a	s
life	s
saver,	s
thank	s
you	s
very	s
much	s
For	s
example,	s
when	s
I	s
call	s
the	s
object	s
ends	s
up	s
with	s
a	s
value	s
of	s
findMaxRepeatCountInWord('expected')	c
letterCount	c
{	c

}	c
Try	s
testing	s
with	s
(and	s
using	s
forEach	s
instead	s
of	s
map)	s
instead	s
!hasOwnProperty	c
I	s
don't	s
think	s
the	s
function	s
works	s
for	s
an	s
array	s
of	s
number	s
though	s
does	s
it	s
Math.max	c
Your	s
code	s
is	s
correct,	s
apart	s
from	s
the	s
if-condition:	s
if(letterCount[v]	c
!=	c
true)	c
Right,	s
but	s
the	s
original	s
code	s
has	s
parenthesis	s
in	s
place	s
of	s
brackets,	s
which	s
is	s
important	s
to	s
change	s
too.	s
Works	s
like	s
a	s
expression	s
grouping	s
and	s
of	s
course	s
that	s
requires	s
already	s
to	s
exist	s
myDict[100]	c
However	s
even	s
prettier	s
would	s
be	s
mydict[100]	c
=	c
mydict.get(100,	c
0)	c
+	c
1	c
I	s
think	s
you	s
can	s
easily	s
fix	s
it	s
by	s
checking	s
if	s
a	s
tokens[i].equals("")	c
Thus	s
checking	s
if	s
a	s
word	s
is	s
an	s
empty	s
string	s
Why	s
don't	s
you	s
get	s
rid	s
of	s
all	s
occurrences	s
of	s
2	s
or	s
more	s
adjacent	s
spaces	s
and	s
then	s
split	s
This	s
works	s
even	s
with	s
the	s
header	s
line	s
includes	s
special	s
characters	s
This	s
works	s
even	s
if	s
there	s
are	s
multiple	s
blank	s
lines	s
in	s
a	s
row.	s
The	s
line	s
breaks	s
in	s
the	s
code	s
are	s
optional	s
Use	s
to	s
remove	s
anywhere	s
in	s
the	s
line	s
instead	s
of	s
just	s
removing	s
the	s
prefix	s
s/\Q$re//g	c
To	s
be	s
fair:	s
Just	s
like	s
karakfa	s
makes	s
assumptions,	s
you	s
also	s
do	s
or	s
you	s
can	s
use	s
method	s
is_null()	c
But	s
the	s
method	s
give	s
you	s
single	s
element,	s
not	s
a	s
collection	s
or	s
array	s
first()	c
Instead	s
of	s
using	s
count	s
you	s
can	s
directly	s
check	s
variable	s
itself	s
is	s
it	s
defined	s
or	s
null	s
if	s
you	s
use	s
return	s
a	s
collection	s
using	s
then	s
you	s
can	s
check	s
->get()	c
$admin->count()	c
Change	s
with	s
the	s
code	s
above	s
if	c
(count($admin))	c
but	s
when	s
if	s
condition	s
true	s
the	s
blank	s
page	s
come	s
rather	s
than	s
print	s
message	s
in	s
if	s
condition	s
Just	s
replace	s
with	s
if	c
(count($admin))	c
if	c
(!empty($admin))	c
The	s
variable	s
name	s
given	s
in	s
wrong	s
way.	s
This	s
is	s
because	s
scope	s
of	s
this	s
variable	s
is	s
only	s
inside	s
if	s
block	s
$myfd_query	c
It	s
will	s
be	s
much	s
more	s
easier	s
to	s
understand	s
it,	s
even	s
for	s
the	s
author	s
of	s
that	s
code.	s
you	s
set	s
variable	s
only	s
when	s
but	s
always	s
execute	s
query	s
isset($_POST["submit"])	c
should	s
be	s
something	s
like:	s
$myfd_query="INSERT	c
INTO	c
'logi'(firstname,lastname)	c
VALUES('$fname','$lname')";	c
Do	s
not	s
quote	s
table	s
name	s
by	s
'	s
or	s
"	s
symbols	s
Better	s
to	s
use	s
placeholders,	s
instead	s
of	s
putting	s
variables	s
inside	s
string	s
Why	s
I	s
can't	s
use	s
method	s
which	s
pre-defined	s
in	s
ArrayList	s
class?	s
get()	c
I	s
would	s
go	s
with	s
d.as_integer_ratio()[1]	c
==	c
1	c
Ah,	s
the	s
is	s
better	s
than	s
and	s
counting	s
trailing	s
zeros	s
as_integer_ratio	c
as_tuple	c
since	s
they	s
are	s
integers	s
by	s
definition	s
but	s
lack	s
an	s
attribute	s
is_integer	c
At	s
this	s
point,	s
it's	s
worth	s
considering	s
all	s
of	s
the	s
other	s
answers	s
Why	s
do	s
not	s
check	s
if	s
the	s
difference	s
between	s
the	s
truncation	s
to	s
integer	s
and	s
the	s
exact	s
value	s
is	s
not	s
zero	s
the	s
rest	s
is	s
correct.	s
(*t	c
==	c
&x)	c
Likewise	s
with	s
we	s
now	s
notice	s
that	s
just	s
like	s
above	s
int	c
**t	c
=	c
&p	c
The	s
assignment	s
in	s
returns	s
a	s
non-null	s
pointer	s
bool	c
a	c
=	c
(*t	c
=	c
&x);	c
Now	s
this	s
could	s
be	s
read	s
as	s
is	s
an	s
is	s
an	s
and	s
is	s
an	s
x	c
int	c
*p	c
int	c
**t	c
int	c
if	s
you	s
extended	s
the	s
code	s
provided	s
with	s
and	s
use	s
int	c
y	c
=	c
99;	c
int	c
*p	c
=	c
&y;	c
and	s
you	s
could	s
then	s
print	s
various	s
values	s
and	s
addresses	s
before	s
the	s
line	s
bool	c
and	s
print	s
various	s
values	s
and	s
addresses	s
afterwards	s
I	s
just	s
find	s
myself	s
not	s
sure	s
whether	s
I	s
understand	s
how	s
you	s
are	s
explaining	s
what's	s
going	s
on	s
I	s
struggle	s
with	s
it	s
all	s
the	s
time	s
Were	s
this	s
comparison,	s
the	s
expression	s
would	s
compare	s
the	s
same	s
values,	s
and	s
would	s
be	s
true	s
Since	s
C	s
considers	s
and	s
true	s
anything	s
not	s
equal	s
to	s
0	s
false=0	c
I	s
need	s
to	s
tell	s
whether	s
a	s
will	s
be	s
true	s
or	s
false,	s
and	s
the	s
correct	s
answer	s
is	s
true	s
Another	s
way	s
to	s
sort	s
longer	s
numbers	s
is	s
realizing	s
you	s
are	s
just	s
sorting	s
by	s
the	s
reversed	s
number	s
Define	s
a	s
lambda	s
function	s
to	s
pull	s
out	s
the	s
digits	s
you	s
want,	s
and	s
use	s
it	s
as	s
the	s
sort	s
key.	s
Under	s
the	s
hood,	s
Python	s
will	s
use	s
and	s
in	s
that	s
order	s
to	s
determine	s
whether	s
an	s
item	s
lies	s
in	s
a	s
given	s
contains	s
__contains__(self,	c
item)	c
__iter__(self)	c
__getitem__(self,	c
key)	c
this	s
is	s
the	s
idiomatic	s
way	s
to	s
accomplish	s
said	s
goal	s
If	s
it's	s
just	s
a	s
substring	s
search	s
you	s
can	s
use	s
string.find("substring")	c
for	s
highlighting	s
the	s
gotchas	s
involved	s
in	s
substring	s
searches	s
Once	s
again,	s
you	s
must	s
consider	s
if	s
you	s
want	s
to	s
include	s
punctuation	s
as	s
a	s
delimiter	s
for	s
a	s
word	s
it	s
only	s
splits	s
when	s
it	s
sees	s
all	s
of	s
the	s
delimiter	s
characters,	s
contiguously,	s
in	s
that	s
exact	s
order.	s
If	s
you	s
truly	s
need	s
a	s
method	s
instead	s
of	s
an	s
operator	s
Basically,	s
you	s
want	s
to	s
find	s
a	s
substring	s
in	s
a	s
string	s
in	s
Python	s
It's	s
quite	s
simple	s
and	s
intuitive	s
Here,	s
we	s
call	s
the	s
method	s
on	s
the	s
string	s
in	s
which	s
substring	s
is	s
to	s
found	s
.find()	c
The	s
value	s
returned	s
is	s
the	s
index	s
where	s
substring	s
was	s
found.	s
Does	s
Python	s
have	s
a	s
string	s
contains	s
substring	s
method?	s
Yes,	s
but	s
Python	s
has	s
a	s
comparison	s
operator	s
that	s
you	s
should	s
use	s
instead	s
Methods	s
that	s
start	s
with	s
underscores	s
are	s
considered	s
semantically	s
private	s
Other	s
languages	s
may	s
have	s
no	s
methods	s
to	s
directly	s
test	s
for	s
substrings,	s
and	s
so	s
you	s
would	s
have	s
to	s
use	s
these	s
types	s
of	s
methods	s
so	s
don't	s
use	s
instead	s
of	s
s.find(ss)	c
!=	c
-1	c
ss	c
in	c
s	c
No,	s
there	s
isn't	s
any	s
method	s
string.contains(str)	c
Here	s
is	s
a	s
more	s
complex	s
working	s
example	s
Could	s
the	s
list	s
iterable	s
be	s
switched	s
around	s
to	s
look	s
for	s
any	s
of	s
the	s
list	s
in	s
a	s
single	s
string	s
So	s
apparently	s
there	s
is	s
nothing	s
similar	s
for	s
vector-wise	s
comparison	s
You	s
can	s
use	s
this	s
syntax:	s
It's	s
work	s
fine	s
for	s
lists,	s
tuples,	s
sets	s
and	s
dicts	s
You	s
can	s
also	s
check	s
if	s
an	s
element	s
is	s
not	s
in	s
a	s
list	s
with	s
the	s
following	s
if	s
statement:	s
I'm	s
working	s
with	s
Python	s
v2,	s
and	s
I'm	s
trying	s
to	s
find	s
out	s
if	s
you	s
can	s
tell	s
if	s
a	s
word	s
is	s
in	s
a	s
string.	s
I	s
have	s
found	s
some	s
information	s
about	s
identifying	s
if	s
the	s
word	s
is	s
in	s
the	s
string	s
but	s
keep	s
in	s
mind	s
that	s
this	s
matches	s
a	s
sequence	s
of	s
characters,	s
not	s
necessarily	s
a	s
whole	s
word	s
If	s
you	s
want	s
to	s
find	s
out	s
whether	s
a	s
whole	s
word	s
is	s
in	s
a	s
space-separated	s
list	s
of	s
words	s
This	s
elegant	s
method	s
is	s
also	s
the	s
fastest	s
This	s
is	s
my	s
favourite	s
answer	s
I	s
agree,	s
but	s
the	s
quickest	s
solution	s
doesn't	s
ignore	s
case	s
like	s
re.compile()	c
find	s
returns	s
an	s
integer	s
representing	s
the	s
index	s
of	s
where	s
the	s
search	s
item	s
was	s
found	s
This	s
small	s
function	s
compares	s
all	s
search	s
words	s
in	s
given	s
text	s
then	s
you	s
need	s
re.escape(word)	c
Advanced	s
way	s
to	s
check	s
the	s
exact	s
word,	s
that	s
we	s
need	s
to	s
find	s
in	s
a	s
long	s
string:	s
Using	s
regex	s
is	s
generall	s
solution,	s

treated	s

Hence,	s

I	s
don't	s
know	s

to	s
do.	s
You	s
can	s
play	s
with	s
some	s
slicing	s

gather	s

from	s
original	s

another	s

sum	s
it	s
up	s

append	s

This	s
answer	s

it	s
might	s
be	s
useful	s

you	s
want	s
to	s
convert	s
a	s
dense	s
representation	s
to	s
sparse	s

In	s
this	s
case,	s
we	s
convert	s
the	s
1D	s
array	s
to	s
2D	s
array	s
with	s

For	s

you	s

use	s

np.sum	c
Here	s
is	s
a	s
minimal	s
example:	s
will	s
cause	s

because	s
it	s
will	s
do	s
with	s
type,	s
even	s
though	s
is	s
not	s
a	s
arithmetic	s
type(iow,	s

go	s

logically).	s
foo<incomplete_type>	c
f;	c

So,	s
I	s
want	s

trigger	s
the	s

Yes,	s
it	s

Do	s
you	s

wrap	s

the	s
most	s
efficient	s
solution/algorithm	s
for	s
this?	s
I	s
am	s
also	s
adding	s
my	s
code	s
for	s
Sieve's	s
algorithm.	s
You	s
can	s
check	s
either	s
it	s
is	s
a	s
prime	s
number	s
or	s
not:	s
This	s
method	s
skip	s
all	s
even	s
numbers	s
and	s
only	s
try	s
up	s
to	s
the	s
square	s
root	s
of	s
the	s
number.	s
It	s
is	s
working	s
fine	s
for	s
your	s
given	s
number	s
This	s
is	s
,	s
Sieve	s
is	s
much	s
better,	s
but	s
it	s
still	s
does	s
not	s
give	s
output	s
in	s
desired	s
time.	s
O(sqrt(N))	c
I	s
always	s
use	s
this	s
code	s
to	s
check	s
if	s
an	s
int	s
is	s
prime	s
It's	s
inefficient	s
to	s
create	s
the	s
sieve	s
just	s
for	s
testing	s
a	s
few	s
numbers.	s
A	s
ten	s
digit	s
number	s
is	s
rather	s
small	s
in	s
this	s
context	s
as	s
if	s
it's	s
a	s
non-prime,	s
it	s
must	s
have	s
a	s
divisor	s
between	s
two	s
and	s
.	s
sqrt(9_999_999_999)	c
So	s
you	s
check	s
if	s
it's	s
even	s
and	s
then	s
there	s
are	s
50k	s
divisor	s
candidates	s
to	s
check.	s
If	s
you	s
don't	s
want	s
to	s
do	s
it	s
yourself,	s
there's	s
directly	s
in	s
the	s
JDK.	s
BigInteger.valueOf(x).isProbablePrime(certainty)	c
There's	s
also	s
in	s
Guava.	s
LongMath.isPrime(long	c
x)	c
So	s
a	s
couple	s
of	s
issues	s
with	s
this	s
code	s
Dheeraj.	s
I'll	s
try	s
to	s
explain	s
them	s
one	s
by	s
one.	s
The	s
first	s
thing	s
that	s
you	s
are	s
trying	s
to	s
set	s
your	s
numeric	s
type	s
values	s
under	s
column	s
F	s
as	s
String	s
objects	s
by	s
putting	s
them	s
inside	s
inverted	s
commas	s
and	s
trying	s
to	s
divide	s
a	s
string	s
via	s
an	s
integer.	s
So	s
obviously	s
it	s
will	s
give	s
you	s
an	s
error.	s
Secondly,	s
you're	s
trying	s
to	s
put	s
a	s
conditional	s
statement	s
on	s
the	s
whole	s
column	s
by	s
using	s
while	s
you	s
are	s
iterating	s
over	s
row	s
by	s
row.	s
final_df['D']=='Kg';	c
So	s
if	s
you	s
are	s
doing	s
this	s
via	s
iterations,	s
then	s
you	s
should	s
refer	s
to	s
a	s
certain	s
row	s
as	s
well,	s
like	s
this	s
-	s
final_df['D'][row]=='Kg'	c
Another	s
issue	s
is	s
with	s
the	s
iteration	s
method.	s
While	s
your	s
loop	s
was	s
iterating	s
4	s
times,	s
but	s
it	s
was	s
of	s
no	s
good	s
to	s
iterate	s
over	s
using	s
.	s
iterrows()	c
I'll	s
suggest	s
to	s
use	s
the	s
length	s
and	s
create	s
the	s
range	s
of	s
values	s
and	s
use	s
this	s
as	s
an	s
index(which	s
you	s
can	s
see	s
on	s
my	s
answer	s
below).	s
In	s
addition	s
to	s
Viveks	s
answer	s
using	s
,	s
you	s
could	s
also	s
consider	s
the	s
,	s
which	s
is	s
a	s
method	s
specifically	s
to	s
update	s
a	s
column	s
where	s
a	s
condition	s
is	s
true:	s
np.where	c
df.mask	c
With	s
combination	s
of	s
functions:	s
to_numeric	c
+	c
isin	c
+	c
replace	c
I	s
have	s
two	s
input,	s
when	s
text	s
changes	s
after	s
a	s
calculation	s
i	s
have	s
to	s
display	s
result	s
on	s
a	s
in	s
same	s
activity.	s
EditText	c
textView	c
is	s
not	s
working	s
for	s
me	s
addTextChangedListener	c
What	s
is	s
the	s
problem?	s
try	s
by	s
perimeterdetails.setText(s+"");	c
Not	s
getting	s
any	s
result	s
on	s
,	s
even	s
after	s
trying	s
TextView	c
perimeterdetails.setText(s+"");	c
The	s
Code	s
of	s
Above	s
works	s
for	s
me....	s
Cause	s
you	s
are	s
define	s
your	s
text	s
view	s
in	s
onTextChanged	c
cut	s
this	s
line	s
befor	s
TextView	c
perimeterdetails	c
=	c
(TextView)	c
findViewById(R.id.perimeterdetails);	c
addTextChangedListener	c
Still	s
not	s
working	s
:(	s
Change	s
the	s
condition	s
:	s
to	s
if(!s.equals("")){}	c
if(s.length()!=0){}	c
So	s
basically	s
i	s
am	s
trying	s
to	s
make	s
two	s
commands	s
called	s
and	s
and	s
when	s
the	s
user	s
types	s
in	s
it	s
will	s
start	s
this	s
infinite	s
for	s
loop	s
and	s
once	s
the	s
user	s
types	s
the	s
infinite	s
for	s
loop	s
will	s
stop.	s
!on	c
!off	c
!on	c
!off	c
I	s
have	s
already	s
tried	s
many	s
methods	s
but	s
it	s
doesn't	s
work	s
such	s
as	s
another	s
for	s
loop	s
such	s
as:	s
How	s
are	s
you	s
getting	s
?	s
userInput	c
Why	s
not	s
loop	s
until	s
is	s
not	s
with	s
a	s
while	s
loop?	s
userInput	c
!off	c
What	s
you	s
want	s
to	s
do	s
is	s
while	c
(condition	c
is	c
true)	c
{	c
do	c
something	c
}	c
It	s
seems	s
that	s
the	s
problem	s
here	s
is	s
in	s
your	s
for	s
loop.	s
Your	s
for	s
loop	s
triggers	s
an	s
infinite	s
loop	s
because	s
the	s
variable	s
i	s
is	s
not	s
being	s
incremented,	s
and	s
will	s
stay	s
under	s
10	s
infinitely.	s
for(int	c
i=0;	c
i<10)	c
Replacing	s
the	s
for	s
loop	s
with	s
and	s
see	s
if	s
executing	s
the	s
loop	s
still	s
results	s
in	s
an	s
infinite	s
loop.	s
for	c
(int	c
i	c
=	c
0;	c
i	c
<	c
10;	c
++i)	c
Yes,	s
i	s
know	s
it's	s
posting	s
a	s
infinite	s
loop.	s
I	s
want	s
it	s
to	s
be	s
infinite.	s
First,	s
this	s
is	s
logically	s
and	s
syntactically	s
nonsense.	s
Don't	s
do	s
this.	s
What	s
you	s
are	s
looking	s
for	s
is	s
probably	s
something	s
closer	s
to	s
this:	s
I	s
know	s
this	s
goes	s
against	s
the	s
definition	s
of	s
random	s
numbers,	s
but	s
still	s
I	s
require	s
this	s
for	s
my	s
project.	s
For	s
instance,	s
I	s
want	s
to	s
generate	s
an	s
array	s
with	s
5	s
random	s
elements	s
in	s
.	s
range(0,	c
200)	c
Now,	s
I	s
want	s
each	s
of	s
the	s
elements	s
to	s
have	s
a	s
difference	s
of	s
at	s
least	s
15	s
between	s
them.	s
So	s
the	s
random	s
array	s
should	s
look	s
something	s
like	s
this:	s
I	s
can	s
generate	s
random	s
numbers	s
using	s
numpy:	s
However,	s
I	s
am	s
not	s
able	s
to	s
keep	s
a	s
consistent	s
difference	s
of	s
at	s
least	s
15.	s
You	s
show	s
only	s
integers	s
in	s
the	s
question.	s
Is	s
that	s
what	s
you	s
want,	s
or	s
can	s
the	s
random	s
values	s
be	s
floating	s
point	s
(e.g.	s
)?	s

I	s
need	s
to	s
write	s
a	s
code	s
to	s
give	s
a	s
number	s
and	s
print	s
me	s
the	s
.	s
F[number]	c
This	s
code	s
is	s
pretty	s
slow.	s
Any	s
ideas	s
for	s
a	s
faster	s
code?	s
is	s
completely	s
pointless;	s
the	s
range	s
loop	s
is	s
using	s
the	s
original	s
.	s
n	c

I'm	s
guessing	s
you	s
started	s
with	s
a	s
while	s
loop	s
based	s
solution,	s
changed	s
to	s
for,	s
then	s
didn't	s
delete	s
the	s
.	s
n-=1	c
which	s
performs	s
work	s
rather	s
than	s
work.	s
O(n)	c
O(2**n)	c
Memoizing	s
could	s
speed	s
up	s
the	s
recursive	s
solution	s
(by	s
decorating	s
with	s
),	s
but	s
it's	s
hardly	s
worth	s
the	s
trouble	s
when	s
the	s
iterative	s
solution	s
is	s
just	s
so	s
much	s
faster	s
and	s
requires	s
no	s
cache	s
in	s
the	s
first	s
place.	s
fibo	c
@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)	c
I	s
want	s
to	s
convert	s
the	s

You	s

a	s

some	s
kind.	s

{0:	c

It	s
can't	s
be	s
done	s
without	s
map,	s
reduce,	s
or	s
similar	s
loop	s
You'll	s
want	s
to	s
use	s
the	s

You	s
may	s

an	s

Here	s
is	s

I	s
am	s
having	s
a	s
hard	s
time	s
understanding	s
why.	s
I	s
ask	s
if	s
any	s
commenters	s
could	s
leave	s
comments	s
line	s
by	s
line	s
to	s
help	s
aid	s
my	s
understanding	s
of	s
this	s
program.	s
I	s
wrote	s
it	s
with	s
assistance	s
of	s
researching	s
similar	s
problems	s
but	s
still	s
having	s
a	s
hard	s
time	s
understanding.	s
Here	s
is	s
a	s
concise	s
version	s
using	s
:	s
Array.reduce	c
You	s
was	s
accessing	s
a	s
3-level	s
deep	s
on	s
the	s
root	s
array,	s
so	s
you	s
where	s
indexing	s
the	s
strings	s
inside	s
the	s
2-level	s
arrays.	s
Using	s
this:	s
you	s
was	s
accessing	s
the	s
first	s
character	s
of	s
the	s
string	s
inside	s
the	s
array	s
on	s
index	s
.	s
key	c
=	c
table_data[i][j][0]	c
j-placed	c
i	c
And	s
using	s
this:	s
you	s
was	s
accessing	s
the	s
second	s
character	s
of	s
the	s
string	s
inside	s
the	s
array	s
on	s
index	s
.	s
value	c
=	c
table_data[i][j][1]	c
j-placed	c
i	c
Also,	s
you	s
already	s
know	s
the	s
first	s
array	s
are	s
the	s
keys	s
(or	s
headers),	s
so	s
you	s
don't	s
want	s
to	s
loop	s
on	s
it.	s
Your	s
code	s
contains	s
three	s
errors	s
which	s
can	s
be	s
fixed	s
as	s
follows:	s
Start	s
iterating	s
your	s
outer	s
loop	s
from	s
to	s
skip	s
headers,	s
which	s
are	s
at	s
index	s
0.	s
i	c
=	c
1	c
Index	s
into	s
the	s
headers	s
array	s
with	s
instead	s
of	s
,	s
which	s
is	s
one	s
dimension	s
too	s
many	s
(accessing	s
characters)	s
and	s
incorrectly	s
includes	s
the	s
row	s
index	s
.	s
tableData[0][j]	c
tableData[i][j][0]	c
i	c
Index	s
into	s
your	s
data	s
table	s
with	s
instead	s
of	s
,	s
which	s
again	s
accesses	s
characters	s
within	s
your	s
strings.	s
tableData[i][j]	c
tableData[i][j][1]	c
Beyond	s
this,	s
I	s
recommend	s
paying	s
attention	s
to	s
spacing,	s
semicolons	s
and	s
camelCasing	s
conventions.	s
This	s
will	s
make	s
your	s
code	s
easier	s
to	s
understand	s
and	s
debug.	s
I'm	s
trying	s
to	s
update	s
the	s

using	s

I	s
would	s

use	s

something	s

not.	s
I	s

I	s
find	s

a	s

why	s

I	s
have	s
list	s

that	s

the	s

and	s
the	s
list	s

students	s
for	s
the	s
course.	s
So	s
I	s
can	s
write	s
which	s
gives	s
me	s
a	s
map	s
Now	s
I	s
have	s
to	s
iterate	s

again	s
to	s
create	s
a	s

map.values();	c
Not	s
exactly	s
what	s
you've	s
asked,	s
but	s
here's	s
a	s
compact	s
way	s
to	s
accomplish	s
what	s
you	s
want,	s
just	s
for	s
completeness:	s
This	s
assumes	s
StudentResponse	s
has	s
a	s
constructor	s
that	s
accepts	s
the	s
course	s
as	s
an	s
argument	s
and	s
a	s
getter	s
for	s
the	s
student	s
list,	s
and	s
that	s
this	s
list	s
is	s
mutable	s
(i.e.	s
)	s
so	s
that	s
we	s
can	s
add	s
the	s
current	s
student	s
to	s
it.	s
ArrayList	c
While	s
the	s
above	s
approach	s
works,	s
it	s
clearly	s
violates	s
a	s
fundamental	s
OO	s
principle,	s
which	s
is	s
encapsulation.	s
If	s
you	s
are	s
OK	s
with	s
that,	s
then	s
you're	s
done.	s
If	s
you	s
want	s
to	s
honor	s
encapsulation,	s
then	s
you	s
could	s
add	s
a	s
method	s
to	s
StudentResponse	s
to	s
add	s
a	s
Student	s
instance:	s
Then,	s
the	s
solution	s
would	s
become:	s
This	s
solution	s
is	s
clearly	s
better	s
than	s
the	s
previous	s
one	s
and	s
would	s
avoid	s
a	s
rejection	s
from	s
a	s
serious	s
code	s
reviewer.	s
Both	s
solutions	s
rely	s
on	s
,	s
which	s
either	s
returns	s
a	s
StudentResponse	s
for	s
the	s
provided	s
course	s
(if	s
there	s
exists	s
an	s
entry	s
for	s
that	s
course	s
in	s
the	s
map),	s
or	s
creates	s
and	s
returns	s
a	s
StudentResponse	s
instance	s
built	s
with	s
the	s
course	s
as	s
an	s
argument.	s

I'm	s
just	s
starting	s
with	s
Java.	s
I	s
wonder	s
if	s
there's	s
a	s
way	s
to	s
add	s
a	s
method	s
so	s
that	s
any	s
String	s
can	s
call	s
that	s
method,	s
similar	s
to	s
how	s
we	s
have	s
now	s
that	s
you	s
could	s
use	s
.	s
string1.equals(string2)	c
string1.equalsOr(string2,	c
string3,	c
string4,	c
string5)	c
To	s
determine	s
if	s
string	s
equals	s
any	s
of	s
the	s
parameters	s
passed	s
to	s
.	s
Stream.of()	c
This	s
is	s
not	s
as	s
pretty	s
as	s
a	s
simple	s
method,	s
but	s
it	s
still	s
gets	s
the	s
job	s
done	s
without	s
having	s
to	s
write	s
your	s
own	s
method	s
equalOr()	c
Is	s
there	s
an	s
easy	s
way	s
besides	s
using	s
the	s
expression	s
to	s
look	s
for	s
all	s
variations	s
of	s
PO	s
Box	s
using	s
javascript?	s
OR	c
(||)	c
The	s
address	s
field	s
is	s
being	s
pulled	s
from	s
a	s
pre-populated	s
database	s
column.	s
I	s
need	s
to	s
disable	s
an	s
option	s
if	s
the	s
address	s
has	s
any	s
variation	s
of	s
PO	s
Box	s
in	s
the	s

Personally	s
i	s
think	s
1st	s
method	s
is	s
more	s
clean	s
and	s
fast.	s
If	s
you	s
use	s

it	s
will	s
return:	s
distinct(listOfTags,	c
["label",	c

false)	c
Then	s
add	s
like	s
.rename	c
df['values'].ne(df['values'].shift()).cumsum().rename('val1')	c
could	s
you	s
please	s
explain	s
it	s
by	s
dividing	s
it	s
into	s
parts	s
as	s
it	s
is	s
not	s
clear,	s
will	s
be	s
grateful	s
to	s
you.	s
df	c
=	c
df.groupby([df['values'].ne(df['values'].shift()).cumsum(),	c
'values']).size()	c
You	s
can	s
keep	s
track	s
of	s
where	s
the	s
changes	s
in	s
occur:	s
df['values']	c
And	s
the	s
changes	s
and	s
also	s
(to	s
keep	s
them	s
as	s
index)	s
computing	s

I	s
have	s
this	s
table	s
structure	s
and	s
sample	s
data	s
along	s
with	s
the	s
query.	s
I	s
am	s
expecting	s
2	s
rows	s
in	s
result	s

It	s

No	s

it	s
is	s
either	s
giving	s
all	s

with	s
max	s
transaction	s
no	s
ignoring	s
the	s

And	s
This	s
means	s
everything	s
is	s
always	s
1	s

You	s

you	s

omit	s

you	s
may	s
see	s
the	s
following	s
snippet:	s
I	s
have	s
a	s
HashSet	s

Persons.	s
A	s
person	s

a	s

like:	s

My	s
task	s
is	s
to	s
get	s
a	s

who	s

older	s

sort	s
them	s
by	s
age	s
and	s
concat	s
the	s

with	s
the	s
lastName	s
like:	s
["Hans	c
Man","another	c

Im	s
just	s

My	s
idea	s
was	s
to	s
sort	s
them	s
first,	s
map	s
the	s
names	s
in	s
separate	s
Streams	s
and	s
to	s
zip	s
them,	s
but	s
it	s
doesn't	s
work.	s
thank	s
you	s
in	s
advance	s
Youâ€™re	s
thinking	s
too	s
complicated.	s
Just	s
use	s
.	s
map(p	c

p.getFirstName()+"	c
"+p.getLastName())	c
This	s
has	s
nothing	s
to	s
do	s
with	s
zipping.	s
And	s
donâ€™t	s
store	s
each	s
stream	s
stage	s
into	s
another	s
variable.	s
Just	s
chain	s
the	s
steps,	s
List<String>	c
result	c

stream.filter(p	c

p.getAge()	c

p.getFirstName()	c

p.getLastName())	c

Here	s
we	s
just	s
map	s

it's	s

Hello	s
I	s
would	s
like	s
to	s
make	s
a	s
javascript	s
function	s
to	s
return	s
7	s
words	s
before	s
and	s
after	s
a	s
math	s
to	s
an	s
specific	s
keyword	s
However	s
when	s
I	s
search	s
in	s
my	s
text	s
"create"	s
I	s
justo	s
got:	s
My	s
complete	s
code	s
looks	s
as	s
follows,	s
with	s
my	s
corresponding	s
string	s
called	s
Text,	s
so	s
I	s
would	s
like	s
to	s
appreciate	s
the	s
support	s
to	s
overcome	s
this	s
task.	s
You	s
can	s
split	s
the	s
text	s
into	s
a	s
words	s
array	s
and	s
find	s
the	s
index	s
of	s
the	s
word	s
then	s
use	s
and	s
Array#slice()	c
Array#join()	c
Your	s
regular	s
expression	s
works	s
perfectly	s
for	s
me.	s
Change	s
to	s
,	s
because	s
you	s
want	s
to	s
match	s
against	s
the	s
string	s
outside	s
of	s
your	s
function.	s
b=text.match	c
b=Text.match	c
Currently,	s
you	s
match	s
the	s
expression	s
to	s
a	s
string	s
containing	s
only	s
the	s
desired	s
word.	s
is	s
a	s
word	s
followed	s
with	s
a	s
comma	s
or	s
dot	s
optionally	s
and	s
a	s
space	s
(?:\w+[,\.]?	c
)	c
matches	s
7	s
words	s
with	s
an	s
optional	s
comma	s
or	s
dot	s
and	s
a	s
space	s

I	s
am	s
looking	s
at	s
this	s
code:	s
I	s
do	s
not	s
understand	s
why	s
I	s
need	s
to	s
use	s
instead	s
of	s
just	s
.	s
()	c
=>	c
this.tick()	c
this.tick()	c
The	s
prior	s
calls	s
a	s
function	s
that	s
uses	s
,	s
yet	s
when	s
I	s
change	s
to	s
,	s
the	s
code	s
stops	s
working.	s
this.tick()	c
()	c
=>	c
this.tick()	c
this.tick()	c
is	s
no	s
longer	s
being	s
called	s
even	s
though	s
it	s
itself	s
is	s
a	s
function.	s
seems	s
to	s
be	s
just	s
an	s
unnecessary	s
step	s
and	s
yet	s
it	s
is	s
necessary.	s
this.tick()	c
()	c
=>	c
this.tick()	c
I	s
think	s
I	s
am	s
misunderstanding	s
functions	s
as	s
objects.	s
is	s
a	s
function	s
that	s
when	s
executed	s
will	s
call	s
with	s
the	s
appropriate	s
context.	s
()	c

this.tick()	c
this.tick()	c
If	s
you	s
didn't	s
want	s
to	s
use	s
arrow	s
syntax,	s
you	s
would	s
need	s
to	s
bind	s
the	s
this	s
context	s
similar	s
to	s
;	s
this.tick.bind(this)	c
If	s
you	s
would	s
have	s
only	s
,	s
it	s
would	s
rightfully	s
call	s
the	s
function	s
on	s
the	s
class,	s
however,	s
that	s
function	s
wouldn't	s
have	s
a	s
this	s
scope...	s
setTimeout(	c
this.tick,	c
1000	c
)	c
I	s
have	s
a	s

List,	s

You	s
can	s
do	s
this	s
via	s
to	s
do	s
the	s
grouping	s

group	s

then	s
use	s

Array.map	c
The	s
way	s
you	s
are	s
using	s
suggests	s
that	s
you	s
don't	s
care	s
about	s
altering	s
the	s
original	s
objects.	s
addAtoO	c
If	s
that's	s
the	s
case,	s
then	s
a	s
simple	s
will	s
do:	s
forEach	c
You	s
can	s
use	s
map	s
as	s
you	s
are	s
using	s
,	s
&	s
use	s
it's	s
index	s
to	s
get	s
the	s
value	s

You	s
can	s
use	s
like	s
this:	s
.map()	c
I	s
have	s
written	s
a	s
method	s
which	s
returns	s
a	s
map.	s
The	s
map	s
can	s
contain	s
more	s
than	s
1000	s
keys,	s
and	s
each	s
key	s
can	s
contain	s
a	s
list	s
more	s
than	s
10000	s
in	s
size.	s
I	s
want	s
to	s
get	s
those	s
keys	s
which	s
have	s
largest	s
list	s
size.	s
Is	s
there	s
any	s
approach	s
to	s
get	s
the	s
result	s
in	s
minimum	s
time	s
if	s
possible?	s
In	s
case	s
you	s
want	s
to	s
store	s
all	s
the	s
keys	s
with	s
the	s
maximum,	s
store	s
them	s
to	s
the	s
and	s
replace	s
the	s
condition	s
with:	s
Set<String>	c
I	s
expect	s
the	s
data	s
are	s
already	s
mapped	s
to	s
the	s
Map	s
structure	s
so	s
I	s
worked	s
with	s
it.	s

that	s
real	s
that	s

your	s
actual	s

You	s
can	s

I	s
have	s
different	s
config	s
files	s
which	s
are	s
basically	s
python	s
files	s
that	s
define	s
variables	s
and	s
I	s
want	s
to	s
import	s
them	s
in	s
my	s
main	s
program.	s
So	s
I	s
can	s
run	s
my	s
program	s
loading	s
those	s
variables	s
into	s
memory.	s
This	s
is	s
in	s
response	s
to	s
your	s
details	s
and	s
not	s
the	s
question.	s
If	s
you	s
want	s
to	s
load	s
variables	s
such	s
as	s
,	s
,	s
from	s
a	s
file,	s
then	s
I'd	s
really	s
recommend	s
some	s
sort	s
of	s
config	s
instead	s
of	s
abusing	s
imports	s
for	s
global	s
variables.	s

Alternatively	s
you	s
could	s
use	s
,	s
which	s
looks	s
nicer,	s
but	s
I've	s
found	s
it	s
to	s
be	s
quite	s
prone	s

I	s
know	s
how	s
to	s
create	s
a	s
file	s
every	s

like	s
this:	s

Hey	s
I	s
would	s
like	s
to	s
know	s
how	s
to	s
show	s
a	s
div	s

hide	s
another	s
at	s
the	s
same	s
time.	s
And	s
that	s
it	s
only	s
does	s
that	s
when	s
I	s
give	s
an	s
input	s
of	s
5	s
or	s
higher:	s
this	s
needs	s
to	s
show:	s

This	s
needs	s

There	s
is	s

console.log(manufacturers)	c
How	s
to	s
set	s
it	s
properly	s
after	s
fetching	s

The	s
problem	s
comes	s
from	s
async	s
logic.	s
Using	s

causes	s
the	s

Always	s
remember	s
itself	s

if	s

do	s
